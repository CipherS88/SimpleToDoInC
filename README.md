# C To-Do List Manager ✨  
**by CipherS88**  

yo~ a super clean, kinda cute but still functional console to-do app i wrote in pure C ♡  
runs anywhere, saves your tasks between sessions, linked list realness, no dependencies — just vibes and pointers (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)

### features i’m proud of:
- add / view / edit / delete / complete tasks  
- auto-saves to `tasks.txt` (pipe format, very demure)  
- works on windows, linux, mac — i got u bby  
- memory leak? never heard of her (frees everything on exit)  

### compile & run (so easy)
```bash
gcc -o todo todo.c
./todo          # linux/mac
todo.exe        # windows
